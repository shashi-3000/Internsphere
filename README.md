# Internsphere

## InternSphere: AI-Powered Internship Matching Platform
üöÄ Project Overview
InternSphere is a functional prototype developed for the Smart India Hackathon (SIH). It addresses the challenge of efficiently and optimally matching student interns with suitable industry opportunities under government-sponsored schemes.

The core of the project is a smart, automated system that moves beyond simple recommendations. It uses an AI-based matchmaking engine to perform a system-wide optimal allocation, ensuring the best fit for both students and industries while considering various factors like skills, qualifications, location, and affirmative action policies.

‚úÖ Current Status (As of September 17, 2025)
The project is currently divided into two main, fully functional services: a React frontend and a Node.js backend. The data collection and user management layers are 100% complete.

## Frontend (React + Vite)
Robust Authentication: Fully implemented user signup, login, and logout flow.

Centralized State Management: Uses React Context (AuthContext) to manage user authentication state across the entire application.

Detailed Onboarding: Multi-step registration process for both Students and Industries, collecting a rich set of data points for the AI engine.

Dynamic UI:

A smart, conditional navigation bar that changes based on login status and user type.

A dynamic profile page that correctly displays detailed information for either a student or an industry user.

Visually appealing and functional dashboard mockups.

Secure API Communication: A centralized axios service layer with interceptors automatically handles attaching JWT access tokens to protected requests.

Backend (Node.js + Express.js)
Secure Authentication API: Full implementation of user registration and login using JSON Web Tokens (JWT), including access and refresh token logic.

Advanced Data Modeling: Mongoose schemas designed to handle two distinct user types (student, industry) linked to a single User model for authentication, using refPath for dynamic population.

Complete Profile Management: Protected API endpoints for creating and fetching detailed student and industry profiles.

Data-Rich Endpoints: API routes are in place to securely provide all student and industry data needed for the AI engine.

Professional Structure: The backend follows a clean, scalable structure, separating logic into routes, controllers, models, and middleware.

Database Connectivity: Successfully connected to and performing CRUD operations on a MongoDB Atlas cluster.

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run the Project Locally
You need to run two separate servers for the application to work.

1. Running the Backend Server
Navigate to the backend directory:

cd backend

Install all the required packages. The npm install command reads the package.json file and automatically downloads all the necessary dependencies.

npm install

Create a .env file in the backend root and add your environment variables:

PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=<Your_MongoDB_Atlas_Connection_String>
DB_NAME=<Your_Database_Name> # e.g., Niyati
CORS_ORIGIN=http://localhost:5173
ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET=<Your_Secret_Key>
ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY=1d
REFRESH_TOKEN_SECRET=<Your_Other_Secret_Key>
REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY=10d

Start the server:

npm run dev

The backend will be running on http://localhost:3000.

2. Running the Frontend Server
Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:

cd frontend

Install all the required packages from package.json:

npm install

Start the development server:

npm run dev

## Database Setup

This project uses MongoDB. Each teammate should:

1. Create their own MongoDB instance (local or MongoDB Atlas free cluster).  
2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory.  
3. Add their MongoDB connection URI in `.env`:
